            <div id="natpis2">
                    Information age changed all the aspects of everyday life and work. The greatest challenge
                    comes for education. It is not only the form, but also the content of education is changing.
                    Not just writing on boards, but also learning informations that can be easily found on the
                    internet lost its primary function. Thus the focus of education becomes artistic, scientific
                    and technological creativity, social and organisational skillness. More holistic approach is
                    arising, especially in children education. Old school motto was “learn, to create” and
                    modern school motto is “create, to learn”.<br><br>
                    Our approach to modern education is based on film. From the first to the fourth industrial
                    revolution film stood out as a revolutionary juncture of art and science. It is “total art”,
                    summarum of all the arts, mixed with technology and social organisation. It is expression
                    of life in all of its aspects.</br></br>
                    Through the process of making films, children can play on a higher level. It is a game that
                    leads them into the world of thoughts and ideas. Learning kids to make films is our
                    secondary goal, the primary one is to inspire them to think about thinking and find
                    enthusiasm in creativity and joint work. It is modern education in action.
